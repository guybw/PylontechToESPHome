# PylontechToESPHome
This project allows you to monitor Pylontech US2000/3000/5000 via ESPHome into Home Assistant.

This project allows you to read infomation from a US2000/US3000/US5000 and display it in ESPHome. I wrote this as I wanted to be able to use an ESP8266 and have it supported in ESPHome.

I've heavily relied on this work https://github.com/irekzielinski/Pylontech-Battery-Monitoring/blob/master/README.md

WHAT WORKS?
STATS, battery SOC, Temperature and voltage

WHAT DOESN'T WORK?
INFO - Anything info does not work right now (I broke it)


If you are in the UK I have a small batch of boards including the cable, custom Pylontech shield a ESP8266 and a custom case for sale for Â£20. Drop me an email at guybw at hotmail dOt com.


If you get anything working please let me know by raising an issue.
